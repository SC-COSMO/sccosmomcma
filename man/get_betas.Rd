\title{Computing force of infection at each time step for the Stanford-CIDE
COronavirus Simulation MOdel (SC-COSMO)}
\usage{
get_betas(time, l_params_all)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Current time at which the model is evaluated.}

\item{l_params_all}{List with all parameters of decision model.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the beta components of the forces of infection for each subgroup
applied to the overall (composite) mixing matrix in the model.
}
\description{
\code{get_betas} provides a wrapper to compute the force of infection
at each time step for the SC-COSMO model. It handles
applying intervention effects and timing to various WAIFW matrices.
